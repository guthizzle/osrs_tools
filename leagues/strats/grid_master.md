Version 1.3

Strategy basic concept is starting off with fast fancy boots and runes into GG rush, picking up some free xp and relics on the way
After that we transiition into 0 time abuse of the equalibrium relics, magic > str/range, fletching > herb / rc (depending on utility of rc might be useless) 3rd option is thieving > agility(this is the 0 time if boots) / mining

bold fairy rings and other notes in parenthesis are generally teleports based on speculative relics, i.e Fairy's Flight

You now have 2/3 0 time xp solutions and are already set up to work on any other tile
By now should have 500 total for lamp, probably use on Slayer or Hunter. Slayer jumps you to atleast 52 for jelly bursting and hunter will very nearly unlock grey chins if only 5x
Next steps are Corrupted shark to have unlimited food, work on xp multipliers and any other extremely powerful and easy to get relics
after fish grabbing an msb/rcb and sending fire cape + w32 inferno unlocks slayer

Con + farming solution is bagged plants
Bagged plant 1 > 2(6con) > 3(12) > Bagged maple(45) > bagged yew(60)(farming stops) > marble fireplaces(63) > marble portal nexi(72) > marble walls(79) > Crystal thrones(95)

Smithing, unsure if bf works, else pray for elf tech

fishing afk karambwans, 2t harpoon or 3t barb

farming just pray for a relic lol
