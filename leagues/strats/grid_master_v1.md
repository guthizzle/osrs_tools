Strategy basic concept is starting off with fast fancy boots and runes into GG rush, picking up some free xp and relics on the way
After that we transisition into a big emphasis on 0 time abuse of the equalibrium relics, magic > att/range, fletching into herb / rc (depending on utility of rc might be useless) 3rd option is thieving > agility(this is the 0 time if boots) / mining

You now have 2/3 0 time xp solutions and are already set up to work on any other tile
By now should have 500 total for lamp, probably use on Slayer or Hunter. Slayer jumps you to atleast 52 for jelly bursting and hunter will very nearly unlock grey chins if only 5x
Immediate next step should really be getting a bryo kc which should be pretty easy
Next steps after that are probably work on fishing for Corrupted shark to have unlimited food, work on xp multipliers and any other extremely powerful and easy to get relics
after fish grabbing an msb/rcb and sending fire cape + w32 inferno unlocks slayer
